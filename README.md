Managing airport runways is a cri cal aspect of air traffic control. This 
simula on models the opera on of an airport with three runways. It 
incorporates realis c challenges such as emergency landings, limited runway 
availability, and varying plane arrival/departure rates. The simula on 
demonstrates how an airport might handle these scenarios efficiently, with a 
focus on reducing crashes, minimizing wai ng mes, and ensuring smooth 
opera ons. 
 
This report explains the simula onâ€™s objec ves, func onality, workflow, key 
metrics, results, and future improvements.
